"Note 1: For 1x1km grids that cross LGA boundaries, the 1x1km Lagos extract includes the name of just one LGA. In the LGA extract, grids that cross LGA boundaries are split based on the percentage of the grid that falls within within the different LGAs. As a result, the totals of indicators by LGA in the Lagos extract are not equal to the totals in the LGA extract.",
Note 2: Latitude and longitude in the Lagos extract are the centroid of each 1x1 km grid. Grids with a population of 0 are excluded. ,
Note 3: 1x1km grids with no population living in the area are excluded.,
Note 4: Spending values are in 2017 Naira,
"Note 5: Energy spending includes spending on electricity and electricity vouchers, charcoal, diesel, firewood, gas, generators, solar panels, kerosene, and other liquid cooking fuels.",
"Note 6: Fraym uses high-quality household survey data in combination with satellite imagery to generate hyperlocal estimates of a variety of population characteristics. To evaluate the quality of these estimates, Fraym performs a variety of statistical checks. For the energy spending thresholds specifically, the hyperlocal estimates have a statistical error of a few percentage points. As a result, for a small portion of grids and for two LGAs (Lagos Island and Warri South-West), the proportion or number of households spending more than 10,000 Naira is higher than the proportion or number of households spending more than 5,000 Naira. ",
"Note 7: Discretionary spending includes all expenses outside of food and water, housing, health, energy, and education. These expenses typically are in categories such as alcohol and restaurants, recreation, clothing, and toiletries.",
